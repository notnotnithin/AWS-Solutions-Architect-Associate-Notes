## What Is IAM?

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS resources.
- Root Account created by default, should not be used or shared.
- Groups can only contain users, not other groups.
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.

![IAM Users & Groups](../images/IAM_Users_Groups.PNG)

- Allows you to manage:
  - **Users**: Each user represents a person in your organization who interact with AWS services and can be grouped.
  - **Groups**: Collection of IAM users with similar access permissions.
  - **Roles**: Set of permissions to be assumed by AWS services or applications.

### IAM: Users & Groups

- **Users**: Represent individual identities that interact with AWS services. Users have unique credentials (username, password, access keys).
- **Groups**: Logical grouping of users to simplify permission management.
  - Permissions assigned to a group are automatically inherited by its users.
- Flexibility in User Management in IAM, users do not have to belong to a group, and a user can belong to multiple groups. This allows user to manage access permissions in a granular and efficient manner. For example, a user could belong to both the “QAs" group and the “Developers” group, inheriting permissions from both.

| **IAM Users**                                              | **IAM Groups**                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Unique identity for accessing AWS services.                | Logical grouping of users to apply common permissions.    |
| Each user has individual permissions based on policies.    | Adding/removing users from groups automatically changes their permissions. |

### IAM: Permissions
- We create users and groups because we want to allow them to use our AWS accounts. In order to allow them to access we need to provide them permissions.
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- Policies allow us to define **permissions** of the users.
- Policies specify what actions a user or a user within a group are allowed to do or denied on specific resources.
- Policies can be attached to:
  - **Users**
  - **Groups**
  - **Roles**
- In AWS you apply the **least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:Describe",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [ 
        "cloudWatch:ListMetrics",
        "cloudWatch:GetMetricStatistics",
        "cloudWatch:Describe"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### IAM Policies Inheritance

![IAM Policies Inheritance](../images/IAM_Policies_inheritance.png)

- Policies are evaluated together for a user, including:
  - **Directly attached policies**.
  - **Group policies**.
  - **Policies attached to roles**.
- If multiple policies apply, IAM combines them to evaluate the final permission set.

| **Policy Type**                 | **Description**                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inline Policies**             | Directly attached to a single user, group, or role.                                              |
| **Managed Policies**            | Reusable policies created and maintained by AWS (AWS-managed) or the customer (Customer-managed). |
| **Group Inherited Policies**     | Policies assigned to groups apply to all users in that group.                                    |

### IAM Policies Structure

- Policies are JSON documents that define permissions.
- Key elements of a policy:
  1. **Version**: Policy language version, always include `2012-10-17`.
  2. **Id**: An identifier for the policy (optional)
  3. **Statement**: Contains one or more permissions (required).
- Statement consists of:
  1. **Sid**: An identifier for the statement (optional).
  2. **Effect**: Either `Allow` or `Deny`.
  3. **Principal**: account/user/group to which this policy is applied to.
  4. **Action**: Specifies which AWS service actions are allowed or denied based on **Effect**.
  5. **Resource**: Specifies the AWS resources to which the actions ares applied to.
  6. **Condition**: Conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional).

#### Example IAM Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    }
  ]
}
```

### IAM – Password Policy

- Once users and groups are created we need to protect them from being compromised.
- We have two defense mechanisms
  * **Password Policy** - because the stronger the password you use, more security for your accounts.
    - AWS allows you to define a password policy for IAM users to ensure strong security standards.
    - You can enforce specific rules to make sure passwords are complex and secure.
    - **Minimum password length**: Set a minimum number of characters (e.g., at least 8 characters).
    - **Require specific character types**:
       * Lowercase letters.
       * Uppercase letters.
       * Numbers.
       * Non-alphanumeric characters (special symbols like `!`, `@`, `#`).
    - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords.
    - Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration). Set the password to expire after a certain period (e.g., 90 days) to prompt users to change their passwords.
    - Prevent password reuse (e.g., prevent using the last 3 passwords).
  * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
    - Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS account.
    - You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users.
    - MFA is a comination of a password *you know* and a security device *you own*.
    - For example, let's take Alice. Alice knows her password, but she also has an MFA generating token and by using these things together while logging in, she's going to be able to do a successful login on MFA.

    ![MFA Benefit](../images/MFA_Benefit.png)

    - Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised because the hacker will need to also get a hold of the physical device of Alice, that could be her phone, for example, to do a login.
    - Enforce MFA for extra security, requiring both a password and a second authentication factor.

### MFA Device Options

![MFA Device Options](../images/MFA_Device_Options.png)
![MFA Hardware Device Options](../images/MFA_Hardware_Device_Options.png)

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **MFA** adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password.
- With MFA enabled, when a user signs in, they must provide:
  1. Their **password** (something they know).
  2. An **authentication code** from their MFA device (something they have).
- Even if a user’s password is compromised, MFA can prevent unauthorized access.

### Benefits of MFA

- Enhances account security by requiring a second form of authentication.
- Reduces the risk of credential compromise and unauthorized access.
- AWS recommends enabling MFA for all IAM users, especially for root accounts and privileged users.
- Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised

## MFA Devices Options in AWS

AWS supports several types of MFA devices:

| **MFA Device Type**                             | **Description**                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Virtual MFA Device**                          | Uses apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. Generates a time-based one-time password (TOTP) on a smartphone or tablet.  |
| **Hardware MFA Device**                         | Physical devices like Gemalto tokens that generate time-based codes.                                                     |
| **U2F Security Key**                            | USB devices supporting the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard. Typically used for browser-based sign-ins.               |
| **AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**       | AWS offers its own MFA solutions integrated with IAM to easily configure and manage MFA devices for users.               |

## How Can Users Access AWS?

* AWS provides multiple ways for users to access resources:

| **Access Method**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Management Console**     | A web-based user interface for interacting with and managing AWS resources visually. Best for beginners and infrequent tasks.                                    |
| **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** | A unified tool to interact with AWS services using commands in your terminal. Suitable for automation and developers. Protected by access keys which we download which allows us to access AWS from our terminal.                                          |
| **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)** | Language-specific APIs for programmatically accessing AWS services using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, etc. Protected by the exact same access keys.                      |
| **AWS CloudFormation**         | A service to define and provision AWS infrastructure using code (Infrastructure as Code – IaC). Allows creating stacks and automating deployment configurations.  |
| **AWS Mobile Console**         | Provides mobile access to manage AWS services on-the-go.                                                                                                         |
* Access Keys are generated through the AWS Management Console.
* Users manage their own access keys.
* Access Keys are secret, just like a password. Don't share them as they can share their own access keys.
* Access Key ID ~= username
* Secret Access Key ~= password
* When Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are loaded into CLI, would allow us to access the AWS API.

## What’s the AWS CLI?

- **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)** is a unified tool to manage AWS services through your terminal or command prompt.
- It allows you to issue commands and automate tasks across multiple AWS services.
- Supports both Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services
- It's open source https://github.com/aws/aws-cli
- Alternative to using AWS Management Console.

### Key Features of AWS CLI:

1. **Command automation**: Write scripts to automate frequent AWS tasks.
2. **Access to all services**: Interact with any AWS service and manage resources from the command line.
3. **Profile management**: Manage multiple AWS accounts using different named profiles.
4. **JSON and YAML output**: Format CLI responses for better readability or integration with other tools.

### Example Commands:

```bash
# List all S3 buckets in your account
aws s3 ls

# Describe EC2 instances in a specific region
aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2
```

## What’s the AWS SDK?

- AWS SDK (Software Development Kit) allows developers to interact with AWS services using various programming languages.
- Language specific APIs - 
  * Python (boto3), JavaScript (aws-sdk), Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP, and more.
  * Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS, ...)
  * IoT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino, ...)
- SDKs provide simplified APIs, making it easier to work with AWS services programmatically without dealing with low-level API calls.
- Example: AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Python named Boto3.

### Key Features of AWS SDK:

- API abstraction: Higher-level abstractions simplify complex operations like S3 object uploads or DynamoDB queries.
- Cross-service integration: SDKs help integrate multiple AWS services together within applications.
- Authentication: Easily manage credentials and authenticate requests using IAM roles or user access keys.
- Retry logic: Handles transient network issues with built-in retry logic.

### Example Usage (Python boto3 SDK):

```Python
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all S3 buckets
response = s3.list_buckets()
print('S3 Buckets:', [bucket['Name'] for bucket in response['Buckets']])
```

### IAM Roles for AWS Services

- IAM roles are used to grant permissions to AWS services to perform actions on behalf of users or applications. They are just *like users*, they will need permissions.
- We assign permissions to AWS Services and to do so, we need to create **IAM Roles**.
- These IAM Roles are just like a user but they are not intended to be used by physical people, but by AWS services. 
- Example use cases for IAM roles:
  1. An EC2 instance can assume a role to access S3 buckets without the need for storing long-term credentials.
  2. An EC2 instance may want to perform some actions on AWS and to do so, we need to give permissions to our EC2 instance. So we create an IAM Role and together they make one entity. Once the EC2 instance is trying to access some information from AWS, it will use the IAM Role and if the permission assigned to the IAM Role is correct, we get access to the call we are trying to make.
  3. Lambda functions can use roles to interact with other AWS services without hardcoding access keys.
- Common Roles:
  * EC2 Instance Roles
  * Lambda Functions Roles
  * Roles for CloudFormation
- Typical Structure:
  - Policies -> attached to -> Roles
  - Policies -> can also be directly attached to -> Groups or Users
  - Roles -> assumed by -> Users or Services
  - Groups -> contain -> Users

![IAM Roles For Services](../images/IAM_Roles_For_Services.png)

### IAM Security Tools

1. **IAM Credential Report (account-level)**:
   - A report that provides details about all IAM users in the AWS account, including the status of their passwords and access keys.
   - Useful for auditing and reviewing user credentials.

2. **IAM Access Advisor (user-level)**:
   - Shows service permissions granted to a user and indicates the last time those permissions were used.
   - Helps identify unnecessary permissions that can be revoked for least privilege.
   - Access Advisor has been renamed Last Access.

3. **IAM Policy Simulator**:
   - A tool that lets you test and validate the impact of IAM policies before applying them to users, groups, or roles.
   - Helps to understand which actions are allowed or denied based on current policies.

### IAM Guidelines & Best Practices

1. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Grant only the permissions required to perform a specific task.
   - Regularly review and adjust permissions as needed.

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Enforce MFA for privileged IAM users (e.g., admin accounts).
   - Adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a code from an MFA device along with their password.

3. **Use IAM Roles Instead of IAM Users for Applications**:
   - Assign roles to AWS resources instead of using IAM user credentials in code or configuration files.
   - Prevents security issues that could arise from accidental exposure of long-term credentials.

4. **Rotate IAM Credentials Regularly**:
   - Regularly rotate IAM access keys and passwords.
   - Remove unused credentials to reduce risk.

5. **Use AWS Managed Policies for Common Use Cases**:
   - AWS provides a set of predefined managed policies that are regularly updated.
   - Managed policies are designed for common use cases and provide a good starting point for granting permissions.

### Shared Responsibility Model for IAM

- **AWS Responsibility**:
  - Protect the infrastructure that runs AWS services.
  - Provide IAM service availability.
  - Configuration and vulnerability analysis.
  - Compliance validation.
  - Offer managed policies for common scenarios.

- **Customer Responsibility**:
  - Manage IAM users, groups, role, policies management and monitoring.
  - Configure IAM policies correctly and apply the principle of least privilege.
  - Secure IAM credentials and enable MFA.
  - Rotate all your keys often.
  - Regularly audit permissions using tools like IAM Credential Report and Access Advisor.
  - Analyze access patterns and review permissions.

| **AWS Responsibility**                                    | **Customer Responsibility**                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protect physical data centers and global infrastructure.  | Manage and secure IAM user accounts and access keys.                                   |
| Maintain the availability of IAM service.                 | Implement strong password policies and enable MFA.                                     |
| Provide IAM managed policies for common scenarios.        | Ensure IAM permissions are correctly configured and follow the principle of least privilege. |
